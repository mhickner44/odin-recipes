    <h1>Pumpkin Pie</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Pumpkin pie is an all-time holiday dessert classic, but maybe it's time for a glow up. For Thanksgiving this
        year, Allrecipes challenged 5 of our favorite bakers to upgrade our basic pumpkin pie recipe. The rules? The
        base ingredients needed to stay the same, and the bakers could only use five additional ingredients for
        their upgrade. Check out the rest of the pumpkin pie recipes from our challenge, here. When it comes to
        holiday baking and I'm short on time or kitchen space, I'm always drawn to pumpkin pie. With pumpkin pie, I
        don't have to pre-cook any ingredients (like sweet potatoes!) or even peel and slice ingredients apple pie,
        I'm looking at you!). Instead, I can whip one together in minutes with a store-bought pie shell, canned
        pumpkin puree, sweetened condensed milk, eggs, and a pumpkin spice blend. But even tried-and-trued holiday
        favorites can use a little updating, which is what this chocolatey twist on pumpkin pie is! I first
        discovered the happy union of chocolate and pumpkin when I swirled some chocolate into my favorite pumpkin
        loaf recipe. The combination was a revelation: The rich dark chocolate added depth to the autumnal pumpkin
        and pumpkin spice flavors. Hence, the inspiration for adding a marbled chocolate twist to this pumpkin pie
        recipe. To keep this recipe simple, I melted dark chocolate and stirred it into some of the pie filling. I
        wanted something visually appealing (hence, the marbling) and that still looked and tasted like pumpkin pie
        (just with a chocolatey upgrade). Since melted chocolate can be heavy, I added an extra egg for lightness. A
        word on the chocolate: When developing this recipe, I used 85% cacao dark chocolate. You can use whatever
        cacao percentage you'd like — just remember the higher the percentage of cacao, the less sweet it is. More
        important is that the chocolate is good quality chocolate, which will melt easily and incorporate into the
        pie filling (look for no additives and a higher percentage of cocoa butter than the cheap stuff).

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
       
            <li class="lists">2 ounces semisweet chocolate, finely chopped</li>
            <li class="lists">1 (9 inch) unbaked pie crust</li>
            <li class="lists">1 (16 ounce) can pumpkin puree</li>
            <li class="lists">1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li class="lists">3 large eggs</li>
            <li class="lists">1 ½ teaspoons pumpkin pie spice</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li class="lists">Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Fit pie crust into a 9-inch pie dish and place it on
            a baking sheet.</li>
        <li class="lists">Melt the chocolate in the microwave or on the top of a double boiler. To melt the finely-chopped
            chocolate in the microwave, melt it in a microwave-proof bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring between
            intervals. Take care not to overheat, which will cause the chocolate to burn and become grainy. Set the
            melted chocolate aside while preparing the remainder of the pie filling.</li>
        <li class="lists">Combine pumpkin puree, condensed milk, eggs, and pumpkin pie spice in a large bowl; mix until combined.
        </li>
        <li class="lists">Measure ½ cup of the pumpkin pie filling and stir it into the bowl of melted chocolate until smooth.
        </li>
        <li class="lists">Pour the remaining pie filling into the pie shell. Dollop the chocolate pie filling on top. Use a
            toothpick or butter knife to create a marbled effect by swirling in and out of each of the dollops.</li>
        <li class="lists">Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue to
            bake until filling is set, 35 to 40 minutes.Remove from the oven, set on a wire rack, and cool
            completely before serving.</li>
    </ol>
